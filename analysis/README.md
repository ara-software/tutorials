# analysis

These are intended to be examples for how to get up and running with ARA data or demonstrate useful things we can do with AraRoot.

We provide examples for two styles of building an analysis. The first is a simple Makefile style--that is in the `make_style` folder. The second is a version that relies on CMake--that is in the `cmake_style` folder.

## Prerequisites
For both of these examples, you will need to have access to a functioning installation of `AraRoot`. You must have your `ARA_ROOT_DIR` environment variable active.

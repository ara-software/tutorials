# simulation

These are intended to be examples for how to get up and running with ARA simulation or demonstrate useful things we can do with AraSim.

The only content, so far, are scripts for how to "mass produce" AraSim on an htcondor cluster.

## Prerequisites
For both of these examples, you will need to have access to a functioning installation of `AraSim`, and all of it's associated dependencies. For extra simplicity, we often assume you have access to the cvmfs installation of AraSim.
